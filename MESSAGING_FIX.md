# âœ… MESSAGING FIX APPLIED

## The Issue
The "Could not establish connection" error was caused by using the old callback-style messaging pattern instead of the modern Promise-based approach required by Manifest V3.

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Old callback pattern
chrome.tabs.sendMessage(this.currentTab.id, { action, data }, (response) => {
  resolve(response);
});
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Modern Promise-based pattern
const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(this.currentTab.id, { action, data });
return response;
```

## Additional Improvements Added

1. **Smart Content Script Injection**: Automatically injects content script if not present
2. **Graceful Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery
3. **Improved Connection Stability**: Handles edge cases where content script isn't ready
