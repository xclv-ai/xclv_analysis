## Analysis Framework

### Content Clarity Metrics
1. **Clarity Score (0-100)**: How easily the message is understood
2. **Comprehension Level**: 
   - Immediate (understood in <2 seconds)
   - Quick (understood in 2-5 seconds)  
   - Slow (requires >5 seconds to process)

### Effectiveness Dimensions
1. **Emotional Resonance (0-100)**: How well content connects emotionally
2. **Action Potential**: 
   - High (strong motivation to act)
   - Medium (some motivation)
   - Low (little motivation)

### Text Quality Assessment
1. **Readability (0-100)**: Ease of reading and processing
2. **Engagement (0-100)**: Ability to capture and hold attention
3. **Memorability (0-100)**: Likelihood of being remembered

## Analysis Task

**TEXT TO ANALYZE:** "{{text}}"

**ELEMENT CONTEXT:**
- Tag: {{element.tagName}}
- Class: {{element.className}}
- ID: {{element.id}}
- Text Length: {{element.textLength}} characters
- Page: {{page.title}} ({{page.url}})

**CONTEXT DATA:**
{{context}}

Analyze this specific text element for messaging effectiveness, clarity, and brand alignment.

- Use exact quotes from the text in recommendations
- Focus on actionable, specific suggestions
- Consider context of surrounding elements
- Evaluate based on intended audience and purpose
