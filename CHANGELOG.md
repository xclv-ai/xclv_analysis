### Critical Loading Guidelines (NEW in v1.2.18)
1. **Safe Class Declaration**: Always check `typeof window.ClassName === 'undefined'` before declaring classes
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Use loading flags like `window.xclvContentLoaded` to prevent re-execution
3. **Namespace Protection**: Store classes on window object to persist across reloads
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with graceful degradation
5. **Version Logging**: Clear console messages for debugging and support
6. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and DOM elements

### Code Quality Standards

2. **Loading Safety**: Prevent duplicate class declarations and script conflicts
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks required for all major functions
4. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all operations
5. **Console Hygiene**: No JavaScript errors in production builds
6. **Testing**: Manual testing required across different websites and loading scenarios
7. **Version Management**: Always increment version numbers for updates

### Pre-Release Checklist (Updated for v1.2.18)
- [ ] **Critical**: Test extension loads with zero JavaScript console errors
