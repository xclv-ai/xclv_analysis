## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For Developer Implementing LLM Integration:

1. **Update background.js** - Fix the `analyzeContent` message handler to:
   - Accept `analysisTypes` array from panel
   - Load corresponding prompt files from `prompts/` folder
   - Execute appropriate Gemini API calls
   - Return structured JSON responses for each analysis type

2. **Test Panel ‚Üí API Flow**:
   - User checks "Tone of Voice" checkbox
   - Clicks "Analyze Page" 
   - Panel sends analysisTypes: ['tone-of-voice'] to background
   - Background loads `prompts/tone-of-voice-analysis.md`
   - Executes Gemini API call with page content + prompt
   - Returns structured response to panel
   - Panel displays results in ToV section

3. **Create Missing Prompts** (if needed):
   - Ensure `message-clarity-analysis.md` exists in prompts folder
   - Verify all three prompt files return consistent JSON structures
   - Test each prompt individually for quality responses

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle API key missing/invalid scenarios
   - Manage rate limiting and quota issues
   - Provide clear user feedback for all failure modes
   - Implement retry logic for temporary failures
